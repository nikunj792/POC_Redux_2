# POC_Redux_2

Steps to run the code.

  i) Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
  
  ii)Open the CMD and run "npm install" to download the dependency present in the package.json file.
  
  iii) In the same CMD in which you did "npm install", run "webpack" that will automatically build your code on any changes as it will be in watch-mode. 
  
  iV)In the second CMD run "npm start" to start the express server on your machine.
  
  V)On your browser run the "http://localhost:3000/" or in case if that will not work then you can go to folder "public/index.html" and directly run this file on browser.
